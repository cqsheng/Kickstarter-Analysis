# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
---
After analyzing successful kickstarter campaigns in the US and Great Britain, some conclusions can be drawn to ensure a successful campaign that will meet or its goals

For starters, May was the month with the most successful campaigns for theaters, as can be seen in the graph in the picture called Launch Date Outcomes.png

In general successful campaigns had lower goals than failed campaigns, although the high goal amount is not the only reason why those campaigns failed. So while I would recommend lowering the goal amount to the average successful goal of $5000 if possible, keeping the goal at the original intended amount of $10,000 could still lead to a successful campaign.

A similar recommendation can be given to the muscial campaign for Great Britain, where only 1 campaign had reached a pledged amount of 4,000 pounds or higher. While lowering the goal to 2,000 if possible can lead to more chance of success.
