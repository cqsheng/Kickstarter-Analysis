# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
    This project is used to determine the different rates of outcomes for kickstarter campaigns regarding theater and plays, whether they are successful, failed or canceled.
### Purpose
    The purpose is to determine if there are any preferred months that would lead to a higher success chance for kickstarter campaigns, as well as how the goal amounts for a campaign can affect the success rate of the campaign. 
## Analysis and Challenges
    An analysis on the success rate of kickstarter campaigns was done based on both launch date and goals for theater and plays.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    An analysis was done for all theater based campaigns, they are also further divided based on the month the campaign launched, and measure against eachother to determine which months had the most successful campaigns in this graph. /Resources/Theater_Outcomes_VS_Launch.png
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    An analysis was done for all campaigns for plays, they are further divided based on the goal amount, and analysis was done to see the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns for each group of goal amounts in this graph. ![Outcomes_VS_Goals.png](Kickstarter-Analysis/Outcomes_VS_Goals.png)
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    Getting the number of successful, failed and canceled campaigns was difficult due to the many different parameters and groups, the groups for higher goal amounts also contains too few data points to draw reliable conclusions.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    May has both the most number of campaigns and the most successful campaigns, followed by June as a close second. Meanwhile Decemeber has the least campaigns and the least number of successful campaigns.
    Although a campaign has a higher chance to succeed than fail in any month, its best to run the campaign in May and worst in December. There are a few canceled campaigns, but they make up a very small part of the overall campaigns.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    Over 90% of all goals are under $15,000, and having a goal under $5,000 leads to a much higher success rate of over 70%. The groupings for goals above $15,000 have very few data points and results won't be too reliable.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    The dataset doesn't contain any locations more precise than country, having a more accurate geograhical location could provide more accurate feedback. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    A percentage of successful plays by month could be helpful, as well as filtering the data to be more specific to each country. A table showing the successful outcomes based on time between launch date and deadline could be useful to see if having a longer campaign impacts the success rate positively or negatively
